This is my coding practice all the code in this was written by Reece.

Requires Python (1.12.3) and Pygame (2.5.2) to run properly

The Cards.txt is designed to be user modifiable to allow for custom games

Users can add .png files to the art folder to use on custom cards

Controls:

  W: Players take turns rolling dice and moving on board
  
  Click on card options to select action
  
(Beta controls will be removed)

  C: Draw a card
  
  R: move Red player forward 1 space
  
  B: move Blue player forward 1 space
